ShortTest.m - MATLAB program that initiates mock sequence generation
recomb_2023_epi.m - MATLAB program function that generates mock sequences
DataProcessing - python script for data processing
EpistasisCalculation - python script for Epistasis calculation

How to use:
0) if using mock sequences - open ShortTest.m and set needed parameters. After the end of calculations remeber the path to saved data files
or transfer them to the EpistasisCalculation folder, skip step 1
1) Process your data (run script via IDE like PyCharm to set parameters and enter path to your data)
2) Transfer processes data to the EpistasisCalculation folder, write name of your data files or full path inside the code and run main.py script from IDE.
(switch and comment other data import if using mock sequnces)
3) Work with images of clusters and .txt files with links in each cluster (you can combine .txt for better look)
